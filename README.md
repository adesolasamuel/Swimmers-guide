# Swimmers-guide

## Inspiration
All the time you see people swimming on the beach, in some scenarios due to lack of forehand knowledge, people go into the deep of the sea by mistake and are put in danger of drowning, this project is inspired to help swimmers and parents determine the depth of the swimming area before diving into the water. 

## What it does

It is a hardware device that can be used to measure the depth of water in the swimming area of the beach or swimming pool to make a forehand decision of whether it is safe for swimming or not. It also measures the water temperature to give individual ideas of whether the water is safe for swimming in or not. 

## How we built it
We use a microcontroller called Seeeduino from Seeed Studio as the central control unit, the device is integrated with a temperature, humidity, and depth measuring module.

## Challenges we ran into

One major challenge we ran into was setting up the sensors to work with our microcontroller which is Seeeduino.


## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Being able to achieve this project in the prototyping phase is an achievement we are proud of.

## What we learned

We learned more about working with Seeed studio products, interfacing different modules with a microcontroller

## What's next for Swimmers' Guide
Integrating a display interface for the device and making it compact so it can be handheld
